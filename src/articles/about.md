# About

[Exaltation](http://cdiggins.github.io/exaltation) is extremely simple, fast, and powerful. It is designed for Github users with at least some rudimentary programming knowledge, but who don't want to go through the effort of having to learn a bunch of web technologies and frameworks just to have a blog that doesn't suck. 

## Motivation

>>>  Damn it Jim, I'm a software developer not a graphic designer!

If you are like me, you might think, I'm a half-descent programmer, creating a personal web-site and blog should take me no more than an hour or two. Oh god, how wrong I was. 

To be honest, writing a blog generator is the easy part. The hard part was figuring out how to structure the HTML and what CSS frameworks to use to make a site look half-decent. 

## Main features

* Article authoring in Markdown 
* Simple article management with support for drafts 
* Designed specifically for blogs 
* Static HTML page generation
* Fast generation of web-pages
* Fast serving of pages
* Versioning history (through Git)
* Google analytics support
* RSS feed generation 
* Blog post authoring in markdown
* Highly configurable from one file
* No complex system of plug-ins or templates 
* Enhanced Mustache templating system
* Responsive web-site generation via Bootstrap

If you are feeling adventurous it is very easy to customize [Exaltation](http://cdiggins.github.io/exaltation). The main build process is contained in less than 200 lines of well-documented JavaScript.

## Alternatives 

There are a large number of [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) that are available for you to play with on Github.
