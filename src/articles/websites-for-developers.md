# Creating a Website for Programmers

    Damn it Jim, I'm a software developer not a graphic designer!

If you are like me, you might think, I'm an experienced programmer ... I know a half-dozen programming languages. Creating a personal web-site and blog should take me no more than an hour or two. 

Oh god, how wrong I was.

# Damn-it Jim, I'm a software developer, not a web-designer! 

After trying to design a web-site which doesn't suck, and failing, I have a new-found appreciation for design professionals and artists. Well, failure has never stopped me before, so I guess I will continue to try and evolve the site design. 

The first step I think to doing something creative is to look around for ideas to steal, *ahem*, I mean inspire. So, in case it is valuable for others, (and because it is convenient for me) I am going to share some of my notes here.
