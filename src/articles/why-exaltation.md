# Why use Exaltation

[Exaltation](http://cdiggins.github.io/exaltation) is simple, fast, and powerful. It is designed for Github users with at least some rudimentary programming knowledge, but who don't want to go through the effort of having to learn a bunch of web technologies and frameworks just to have a blog that doesn't suck. 

## Main features

* Designed specifically for blogs 
* Static HTML page generation
* Fast generation
* Fast serving of pages

If you are feeling adventurous it is very easy to customize [Exaltation](http://cdiggins.github.io/exaltation). The main build process is contained in less than 200 lines of well-documented JavaScript.
